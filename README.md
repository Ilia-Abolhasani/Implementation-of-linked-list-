# Linked List Implementation

This repository contains a C# project that implements various types of linked lists for educational purposes. The project focuses on creating a student data collection application with a graphical user interface (GUI) to input and store student names and scores using different types of linked list data structures.

## Description

The Linked List Implementation project provides an implementation of the following types of linked lists:

- One-sided linked list
- Two-sided linked list
- Circular linked list

The project aims to showcase the functionality and usage of linked lists by providing a student data collection application. The application allows users to enter the name and score of a student using a GUI, and the data is stored in the respective linked list data structure.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ilia-Abolhasani/linked-list.git
2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.

3. Build the project to resolve dependencies.

4. Run the application to start the student data collection.

## Usage

To use the Linked List Implementation project, follow these steps:

1. Launch the application.

2. Use the provided GUI to enter the name and score of a student.

3. Select the type of linked list (one-sided, two-sided, or circular) to store the student data.

4. Click the "Add" button to add the student to the selected linked list.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 to add more students.

6. Utilize the available functionality to perform operations on the linked lists, such as displaying the data, searching for a specific student, or removing a student.

7. Explore the code and comments to understand the implementation details of the different types of linked lists.
